# Mother 3 Repaint Editor
Basic Mother 3 editor made for [Mother 3 Repainted](http://sievaxx.com/repaints/mother3)

Made with magic in Godot 4.0

## What is this?
A **VERY BASIC** mother 3 editor meant for:
- Graphics, Palettes, Tile data
- Text editing (Mother 3 Translation v1.3) with Textbox preview
- Audio editing, tracker and piano roll of Mother 3's songs with live playback + sample replacement
What this is NOT meant for:
- Map editing, Database editing, or anything that edits code unrelated to the game's text.

I have no immediate plans to make this into a generic mother 3 editor, while the rest of the tooling that exists is lackluster which necessitated this tools creation, i do not have the resources or knowledge to solve the problem for others that i am solving by making this for myself. I hope making this in Godot would at least make it easy to understand, modify and extend for future use by others who need it.
