# Mother 3 Repaint Editor
Basic Mother 3 editor made for Mother 3 Repainted

Made with magic in Godot 4.0

## What is this?
A **VERY BASIC** mother 3 editor meant for:
    - Graphics, Palettes, Tile data
    - Text editing (Mother 3 Translation v1.3) with Textbox preview
    - Audio editing, tracker and piano roll of Mother 3's songs with live playback + sample replacement
What this is NOT meant for:
    - Map editing, Database editing, or anything that edits code unrelated to the game's text.

I have no immediate plans to make this into a generic mother 3 editor, while the rest of the tooling that exists is lackluster i do not have the resources or knowledge to make a fully fledged editor by myself. I hope making this in Godot would at least make it easy to modify and extend for future use.
